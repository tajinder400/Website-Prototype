# Website-Prototype
A website which tries to act as a visual novel information website. It does this by implimenting various web technologies.
It comprises of the use of an MVC framework called "Codeigniter".
It makes uses of PHP through codeigniter to draw live information depending on what the user is searching onto a set template page
The website made us of REST API's, such as twitter feeds relevant to the page being browsed, to help the use gain extra information on the topic.
It also had a dyanamic layout which would respond to the device you're usingm, and respond accordingly.
For example, the site will display the mobile site on a mobile device such as your phoen or table. 
This site makes extensive use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

It's purely a proof of concept, and had no intention of being live ready.
