Client Side Twitter Search Geared toward HTML5 Geolocation
===========================================


## Version 0.1.0

## Installation

You can install this by simply cloning this repo to your web server and hitting the index from your browser: 
`git clone git://github.com/coleGillespie/finden.git`.


## Getting started

The idea here is to create a way for twitter users to find people around them. The original idea spawned from a news story I read by the BBC about how their embedded journalists connected with people on the streets of Cairo during the arab sprint using twitter to connect. Imagine if you could see who was around you in real time and respond all from a client side mobile app. HTML 5 is awesome.
